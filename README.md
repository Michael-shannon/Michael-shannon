👀 I’m interested in cross length/time scale super resolution microscopy, and computational bio-image analysis.

🌱 I’m currently learning how the morpho-kinetic behaviour of Natural Killer (immune) cells correlates to their molecular dynamics during migration in differentiation from iPSCs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of exciting imaging projects!

✨ 2023 ✨  

Check out the repos here for...

✨  1) click and go optical flow analysis adapted from Ivan Rey-Suarez and Arpita Upadhyaya (full paper link in repo description).✨ 
 
I used it to track actin and other proteins in migrating NK cells.
 
✨ 2) localization microscopy multi-blinking correction software (DDC) from Christopher H. Bohrer, adapted to work on the AWS cloud.✨ 

I use it currently for STORM data correction, to count molecules in protein clusters/organizing centres.

✨ 3) my own project "cell PLasticity Analysis TOol" or cellPLATO - a morpho-kinetic cell behaviour analysis software for a wide range of data inputs.✨

I am actively developing it, and am currently testing its capability to discern heterogeneous populations of NK cells that change their behaviours on different time
and length scales depending on their subtype and signal source.
